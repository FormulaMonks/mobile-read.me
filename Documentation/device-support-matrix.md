# Support Matrix

There is some considerations that you need to keep in mind when building an App. It is not the same to implement an App that is going to work on the 10 latest devices than implementing an App that is supposed to work on all the devices and all the OS versions. That is why you need to keep these things in mind:

## iOS

So it is of high importance to be able to define these as soon as possible:
* Supported Families (iPhone, iPad, iPod, tv, watch)
* Supported devices within each family
* Supported screen sizes
* Supported capabilities (camera front-back, audio in-out, gyro, cellular data, etc)
* Supported OS's (normally recommended is highest version of the last major, plus whole newest major)

There's also, features that may be implicitly expected on a mobile app. These need to be taken into consideration:
* Localisation
* Accessibility
* Orientations (portrait, landscape)
* Specific device design (for the iPad, for example)
* Security (encryption)
* Offline support
* Deep linking
* Push notifications
* Extensions (today, spotlight, watch, quicklook, share, stickers, etc)

## Android

TBD
