# Coding Style

For coding style, refer to [The Apple Swift Programming Language Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0) and try to emulate how it's done there.

If from that it's still not clear, fall through to [The Official raywenderlich.com Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).

These conventions should eventually be enforced (upon agreement) by lint. One trending tool to do this right on PRs is [danger.system](http://danger.systems/js/swift.html).
