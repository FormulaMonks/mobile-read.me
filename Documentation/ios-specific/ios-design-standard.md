# iOS Design

Always prefer standard components and standard workflows, try emulating default apps (such as Settings, Mail, Clock) and when in doubt refer to the [HIG](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/).

Keep in mind different screen sizes and ratios, as well as different image densities (as regular, retina, plus @3x).
